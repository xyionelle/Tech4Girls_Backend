Branching in Git is a feature that allows developers to create separate "branches" or copies of the main codebase (often called the "main" or "master" branch) to work on specific tasks, features, or bug fixes without affecting the main project. Each branch is like a parallel version of the project, where changes can be made independently. This is especially useful when multiple developers are working on different parts of a project at the same time.

Branches help collaboration by allowing team members to work in isolation on their own features or fixes. Once their work is complete and tested, they can merge their branch back into the main project, ensuring that the code integrates smoothly. This approach reduces conflicts and errors, as changes are made in a controlled environment.
