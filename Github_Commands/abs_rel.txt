An absolute path specifies the full location of a file or directory starting from the root directory (e.g., /home/user/file.txt in Linux), making it independent of the current working directory. In contrast, a relative path indicates the location relative to the current directory (e.g., documents/file.txt), relying on the current position in the file system. Absolute paths provide a complete reference, while relative paths are shorter and dependent on where you are in the directory hierarchy.
